class NagiosCheck(object):
    """
    .. versionadded:: 1.0.0

    Abstracts a basic NRPE state machine
    so that a check can be reduced to its payload only.

    The state machine starts at **STATE_UNSET** indicating that the
    check has not yet expressed any status (if the check existed at
    this point, the exit code would be equivalent to Nagios 'unknown').

    The four other states, **STATE_OK**, **STATE_WARN**, **STATE_CRIT**
    and **STATE_UNKN** correspond to the Nagios values 'OK', 'warn',
    'critical' and 'unknown' respectively.

    States are sticky and transitions follow defined rules, so (for
    example) a check which has asserted 'critical' status cannot later
    rescind that and assert that it is only 'warning' after all.

    Programs *must* call :func:`exit` to return the correct
    error code. Optional messages can be queued up and will be printed
    by :func:`exit` for consumption by the user.

    Example usage:

    >>> n = NagiosCheck()
    >>> n.ok('Everything is fine')
    >>> n.exit()
