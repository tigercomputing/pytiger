Our Linux gurus create and maintain
`world-class systems <https://www.tiger-computing.co.uk/about-us/case-studies/>`_
for high tech businesses. Our Linux support is trusted by blue-chip
corporations like Ericsson, public sector champions such as the NHS, a number
of specialist bio-science organisations including e-Therapeutics, and Oxford
Gene Technology, as well as a whole host of web and digital companies across
the length and breadth of the UK.

We believe that if you have to tell your IT support company about a service
problem, they have already failed.
