Contributions to pytiger are welcome, but should follow some guidelines.

Python Interpreter Version
==========================

Python code should be backward-compatible to version 2.6 of the Python
interpreter. This is subject to change as the major distributions we
support change.

Test suite code may depend on features in later versions as required,
although this should not be gratuitous.

Versioning
==========

pytiger uses the
`semantic versioning scheme v2.0.0 <http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_
for version numbering.

Briefly, that means:

    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    * MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    * MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    * PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

    Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
    extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

The primary version number is stored in *setup.py* but is used in other
places, such as build system control files.

Style
=====

At a minimum, all code should be compliant with :pep:`8`. The
:program:`flake8` tool provides additional code style hints.

All files should be encoded to *utf-8* unless there are exceptional
reasons to vary.

Tests
=====

A basic test should always be included. Tests are not expected to be
comprehensive, but should evolve as bugs are detected. High code coverage
is encouraged.
